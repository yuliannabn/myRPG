# myRPG
A simple RPG game made in CSFML. Uses various configuration files for setting maps and scenes (menus) up. Move with the WASD or arrow keys and click on enemies to attack them. To heal or use your stat points, press 'i' and a menu will appear. You can create a map by modifying src/maps/maze.txt (first layer is ground, second is trees, walls, etc).

Some of the sprites, like the player and the enemies, are made by me ^^.

Made in a group of a total of 4 people.

## TO PLAY
You need to have CSFML installed in your computer to be able to run this game.
